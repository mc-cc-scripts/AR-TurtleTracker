# AR TurtleTracker

Allows the user to locate a turtle running a corresponding program.

## Requirements

To function, the user needs to

- wear the AR Googles from the mod: Advanced Peripherals
- use a tablet while traveling, which sends the location of the player to the ar-server
- setup an AR-Server to receive the location of the turtle and the location of the player

all code required to achieve this, is provided in this Repo, once finished!

## Use case

This extensive setup is only worth it in scenarios with many turtles which are scattered around the world and rescuing would prove difficult otherwise.
